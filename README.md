# Harvard Art Museum API React Project

This project builds on an App Academy assignment from day two of the React module. The original project used create-react-app for a loose walkthrough of building out an unstyled website with a nav bar, a mostly blank homepage, and a handful of routes to different galleries and individual artworks for a total of four components.

Because I found the data set such a joy to work with, I continued to flesh out this project in my spare time. I refactored to use React context instead of props threading and added more browsing features to reflect the functionality of the Harvard Art Museums' actual website.
